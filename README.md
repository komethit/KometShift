 - Download this project to your device, also have downloaded `Python`
   version `3.11` and higher, also have an idea about programming in
   general.
 - Also, download the required file via pip, namely `requirement.txt` and
   paste one command into the command line `pip install -r
   requirements.txt`.
 - To launch applications via the command line, this is one command
   python `setup.py `must already be in this directory beforehand: `cd
   path`.

> Also if you get `pip` error try `pip3` same with `python/python3`.
  
After these steps, you can simply and flexibly customize applications for yourself using the pact system, also customize the application code and write (add) your functions,    a simple example of writing your own package:

```json

    "manifest": "test-pack",
    "state": true,
    "run": {
        "auto-interpretator": true,
